# CatFacts-Sender
A program that sends random cat facts to a specified number and can respond if/when the specified number responds


This was a quick hobby project that would randomly pull a cat fact from a list and send it to a friends cell phone number
at repeated intervals. Additionally, there is code to be run on a public facing flask server that would allow for the
Twilio programmable SMS service to parse and respond to replies as well as do further local action.
